    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p>Cookies:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, mix the flour, baking powder and salt using a fork.</li>
        <li>In an electric mixing bowl, cream the butter and sugar until fully combined, about 5 minutes. </li>
        <li>Add the egg and vanilla extract and beat the mixture.</li>
        <li>Add the dry mixture into the mixing bowl and beat until combined.</li>
        <li>When the mixture is combined but crumbly, knead the dough with your hands and form a ball.</li>
        <li>Line cooking trays with silicone sheets or parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Flour a clean flat surface and place the dough in the middle.</li>
        <li>Flour your hands and the rolling pin and roll the dough out until it is about ¼ of an inch thick.</li>
        <li>Using cookie cutters, cut out cookies and place them at least an inch apart on the cooking trays. </li>
        <li>Re-roll the leftover dough and repeat steps nine and ten until all of the dough is gone.</li>
        <li>Place the cooking trays in the oven and bake for 10-12 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Royal Icing:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk together the powdered sugar, vanilla extract, water and honey until all lumps are gone. </li>
        <li>Divide the icing into different bowls, one for each color, and add the desired food coloring. Add one drop at a time and mix until it is your desired color.</li>
        <li>Fill a piping bag or piping pen with the icing from one bowl and pipe the outline of the cooled cookie.</li>
        <li>Fill in the cookie with icing and use a toothpick to spread the frosting in order to close any gaps.</li>
        <li>Let dry before adding details (if desired).</li>
        <li>Wash the piping bag or piping pen in-between color uses.</li>
        <li>If the top of the icing in the bowl develops a film, add a tiny bit of water and mix.</li>
        <li>Let the cookies dry for about an hour (they take three to four hours to be completely dry).</li>
    </ol>
