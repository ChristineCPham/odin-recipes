        Everyone is in on the new hype surrounding “Squid Game.” If you haven’t watched the South Korean drama, you have probably at least seen references to it on TikTok and YouTube. Along with the many fans signing up for real “Squid Game” tournaments (minus the killing of course), people have also been making the dalgona candy seen in the second game.

    <section class="conclusion">
        <p>If you are trying to complete the “Squid Game” challenge, you will want to use a circle, star, triangle or umbrella cookie cutter to make an imprint in the center of the cookie. There are different ways to try and get the center of the cookie out in one piece. 
        <br><br>
        You can use your bare fingers to break the outer cookie or you can use your tongue to dissolve the outer sugar. The most common and most practical way is to use a toothpick or needle to dig along the lines of the inner cut. If you’re using a needle, the best method is to heat the tip every once in a while.
        <br><br>
        Good luck on completing the second level in “Squid Game.”</p>
